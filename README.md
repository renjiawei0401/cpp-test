# Fractal - CMake Exampleer

This repo demonstrates how to build a small cross-platform library in C++ with CMake, and enable:

1. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) builds for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
2. [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit-tests with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) code-coverage
3. Debian Package generation via [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/CPack.html)1
