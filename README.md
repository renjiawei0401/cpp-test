![](https://travis-ci.org/dorodnic/cmake_tests.svg?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dorodnic/cmake_tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/dorodnic/cmake_tests?branch=master)

This repo demonstrates how to build a small cross-platform library in C++ with CMake, and enable:

1. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) builds for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
2. [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit-tests with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) code-coverage
3. Debian Package generation via [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/CPack.html)
